Callgrind format
================

Some rough notes on the callgrind format. Details and examples are here:
	http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/cl-format.html

The 'main' function is magic for kcachegrind it seems; so we need to
rename existing 'main' functions and insert a top-level to which
everything belongs.
